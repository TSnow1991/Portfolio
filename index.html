      <h2>Future Engineer</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer out of
        a small town called Gun Barrel City, Texas. I have been a sales
        associate for most of my career, in which I had worked very closely with
        people and technology and as such have garnered a greater appreciation
        for both.

      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I grew up in a small town with not a lot to do. But after graduating
        from high school, I moved to the city for college where I learned to try
        as many things as I could because you don't know if you'll like
        something until you try it. After college, I moved back to my small town
        where I settled down, and now I am the father of an amazing daughter who
        keeps me on my toes, and I am also married to one of the most wonderful
        people I've ever met. Outside of school and work I am your everyday
        typical nerd who enjoys TV and movies, table top games, and most of all
        video games.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of my work with technology I have grown to appreciate the
        internet and all you can accomplish due to it and so web developement is
        an exciting and necessary part and the design of websites is a fun
        challenge. I have also come to understand that road blocks are expected
        to pop up from time as well as collaboration breeds wonderful ideas, and
        therefore I'm truly excited to meet and work with others who share my
        passion.
