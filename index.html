  <h2> Future Engineer</h2>
  <p>I am a Thinkful student working on becoming an software engineer out of a small town called Gun Barrel City, Texas

    I am currently a receiving manager for a retail store and I have been a sales associate for most of my career. In
    both of those environments I have worked very closely with technology and as such have garnered a greater
    appreciation for it.</p>

  <h2>
    About Me</h2>

  <p>I grew up in a small town with not a lot to do. But after graduating from high school, I moved to the city for
    college where I learned to try as many things as I could because you don't know if you'll like something until you
    try. After college I moved back to my small town where I settled down, and now I am the father of an amazing
    daughter who keeps me on my toes, and I am also engaged to one of the most wonderful people I've ever met. Outside
    of school and work I am your everyday typical nerd who enjoys TV and movies, table top games, and most of all video
    games.</p>
